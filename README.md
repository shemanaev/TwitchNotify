To add/change monitored Twitch users edit the `TwitchNotify.txt` file next to `TwitchNotify.exe` executable. Put each username in separate line. You don't need to restart application after editing file, it will reload `TwitchNotify.txt` file automatically.

Click on baloon notifications to open stream for Twitch user. You can access all monitored users with right click on icon, it will show checkbox next to users that are currently live. Live stream can be opened in livestreamer, mpv & youtube-dl or a browser. Offline users are always opened in browser.

To use [livestreamer](http://livestreamer.io/) you need to have `livestreamer.exe` file in path. Then set up default quality and player in livestreamer configuration file `%APPDATA%\livestreamer\livestreamerrc`. As a minimum you want to have there following settings:

    player=mpv
    default-stream=best

Change `mpv` to whatever player you use. Read [livestreamer documentation](http://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html#cli-options) about what other options you can put there. You can easily open this file in notepad from popup menu on tray icon.

To use [mpv](https://mpv.io/) with [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) you need to have `mpv.exe` and `youtube-dl.exe` files in path. Then simply enable it in settings menu.
